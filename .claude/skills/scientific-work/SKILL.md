description: Work with the user's general PhD, scientific research materials, and technical Obsidian notes. Use for научная работа, аспирантура, статьи, обзоры литературы, научные заметки, technical term questions that should become Obsidian notes, general modeling workflow, paper translation/analysis, and planning research next steps from the local vault. For specialized plasmonics, nanophotonics, SPP/DLSPP/LR-DLSPP, PCM photonics, EIM/ЭДП, optical antennas, or photonic COMSOL/FEM/CST mode-analysis tasks, use `plasmonics-photonics`.

# Scientific Work (Claude Code adapter)

Shared base skill: ../../../_base/skills/scientific-work/SKILL.md.

When this skill triggers, read that base SKILL.md completely and follow it together with any references/, scripts/, and assets/ next to the base file. Resolve relative resource paths from the shared base skill directory.

Keep this file as a Claude-specific thin adapter: frontmatter and Claude-only trigger wording belong here; durable domain rules, reusable workflows, scripts, references, and lessons belong in the shared base skill.

Notes:
- Ignore agents/openai.yaml; it is Codex-only metadata in the Codex adapter.
- Update the shared base first for behavior changes, then adjust Codex/Claude adapters only when their platform-specific pointers or trigger descriptions need to change.
