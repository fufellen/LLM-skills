# J-Link MCP Runtime

This shared skill preserves a synchronized, runnable snapshot of the J-Link Codex plugin from the ToF-LIDAR MCU firmware repository. The complete plugin is under `plugin/`; resolve paths below relative to this file.

## Startup

1. Read `plugin/skills/jlink-mcp-runtime/SKILL.md` completely for the runtime's current tool workflow and safety rules.
2. If installation or dependencies are uncertain, run `python launcher.py --check` from the `plugin/` directory. This check does not connect to hardware.
3. With the `jlink` MCP server registered, inspect defaults with `get_project_debug_defaults`.
4. If the user has not specified a probe serial number, list probes with `list_jlink_devices` before connecting.
5. Use `connect_project_mcu` for the configured target and check the result with `get_connection_status`.

## Hardware Safety

Require clear user intent before any operation that changes target state or flash contents:

- `reset_target`
- `halt_cpu`
- `run_cpu`
- `write_memory`
- `write_register`
- `erase_flash`
- `program_flash`
- `start_project_jlink_gdb_server`

Read-only discovery and inspection are allowed when they are within the user's debugging request. This includes listing probes, checking status, reading target information, registers, and memory.

## Runtime Defaults

- Device: `STM32H723ZG`
- Interface: `SWD`
- Speed: `auto`
- GDB server port: `54526`
- GDB server selector: `USB`

The plugin documents environment-variable overrides in `plugin/README.md` and `plugin/AGENTS.md`. Do not assume these MCU-specific defaults for another project.

## Source And Mirror Policy

The firmware checkout is authoritative for runtime code. This Google Drive copy is a synchronized safety mirror and portable installation source, not an independent fork.

- Source on this PC: `C:\workspace\ToF-LIDAR-R\.codex\jlink-mcp-runtime`
- Mirrored runtime: `plugin/`
- Snapshot metadata: `references/source.md`

When refreshing the mirror, first update and inspect the MCU repository, then replace the entire plugin snapshot from the project source. Compare relative file lists and hashes, scan for credentials or generated logs, run `python launcher.py --check`, and validate both the shared skill and Codex adapter. Make runtime changes in the MCU repository first, then recopy them here so the two copies do not silently diverge.
