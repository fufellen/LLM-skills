description: Universal venue-agnostic discipline for preparing, reviewing, and QA-ing scientific manuscripts and conference papers. Use for написание статьи, подготовка рукописи, review or proofread an article draft, checking citation order and renumbering references, verifying table numbers against data files, syncing bilingual (RU/EN) drafts, pre-submission checklists, safe bulk edits of manuscript files, and DOCX artifact QA. Venue-specific rules (APEDE/IEEE conference via apede-ieee-conference-article, Оптика и спектроскопия via optics-spectroscopy-article, russian НТО/GOST 7.32 reports via nto-formatting) live in their dedicated skills and override this one; this skill is the shared base that prevents common manuscript mistakes.

# Scientific Article Writing (universal base)

## Purpose

Shared, venue-agnostic rules for manuscript work. Written imperatively so
that ANY model - including weaker ones - can follow them without judgment
calls. When a dedicated venue skill exists, read it too; its rules override
this skill on conflicts. Known venue skills:
- `apede-ieee-conference-article` - APEDE / IEEE two-column conference
  papers (IEEE Xplore);
- `optics-spectroscopy-article` - journal «Оптика и спектроскопия» and
  similar Ioffe journals;
- `nto-formatting` - Russian НТО / отчет о НИР materials per
  GOST 7.32-2017 (lives in the corporate skills submodule
  `nto-formatting/_base/skills/nto-formatting/`).
Conversion mechanics live in `markdown-to-docx`; domain claim rules in
`plasmonics-photonics` / `scientific-work`; RU/EN language purity
(де-кальке) in `ru-language-purity`.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

Violating any of these is a defect, not a style choice.

1. **Never invent facts.** No invented e-mails, affiliations, ORCIDs, grant
   numbers, DOIs, page numbers, material constants, or reviewer names.
   Search the vault and the article's data files first. If not found,
   insert a visible placeholder `[УТОЧНИТЬ: <what exactly>]` and list every
   placeholder at the end of your report. Never delete a placeholder
   without filling it with user-confirmed data.
2. **Never change science while formatting.** Rewording, translating, or
   converting a draft must not alter claims, numbers, signs, or hedges
   ("in the considered cases" must not become "always"). If a formatting
   rule seems to require a science change, stop and report.
3. **Newest validated draft wins.** When several drafts of one paper exist
   (RU/EN, old/new), first determine the scientific source of truth: the
   draft carrying the latest validation results and edit log. Sync the
   others FROM it. Never format a stale draft.
4. **Every number must trace.** Every quantitative value in text and tables
   traces to a data file, script output, or citation. Before trusting any
   table: recompute values derivable from formulas given in the same paper
   and cross-check rows against the source CSVs. Report mismatches; do not
   silently "correct" either side.
5. **Bulk edits only by count-asserted script.** Renumbering references,
   renaming an author, changing units - anything with more than ~3
   occurrences or spanning several files - must be done by a script where
   EVERY replacement asserts its expected occurrence count and the script
   verifies the result (e.g. re-extracts citation order). Never hand-edit
   repeated tokens.
6. **QA the artifact, not the source.** After producing a DOCX/PDF, inspect
   the artifact itself (unzip DOCX, read `word/document.xml`): no raw TeX
   (`\mathrm`, `$`, `operatorname`), no Markdown leftovers (`[[`, `####`,
   `**`), no template guidance text, no `TODO`. Verify tables, figures, and
   required blocks are physically present. **Headings must be black**:
   python-docx/Word default Heading and Title styles are blue - every build
   script that assigns Word heading styles must also force RGB(0,0,0) on
   those style definitions, and QA must verify it by parsing
   `word/styles.xml` (check EVERY build script of the article, including
   secondary-language ones - this is where the rule gets missed).
   Also reject collapsed formula artifacts created by naive TeX stripping:
   missing fraction bars, lost subscripts, and adjacency that changes the
   meaning of equations (for example `beta/k0` becoming `betak0`, or
   `1/(2 Im beta)` becoming `12Imbeta`) are content defects, not typography.
7. **Look at the rendered pages, do not only parse the XML.** Parsing
   `word/document.xml` proves attributes (a `both` value, a border `nil`);
   it does NOT show how the page actually looks - unbalanced columns, a
   caption split from its table, an equation that renders too large, a
   figure that overflows the column, an author line that wrapped badly.
   These are only visible by eye. After building the DOCX, render it to
   per-page images and ACTUALLY VIEW them, comparing against the venue
   template's own example page/table/figure. This is mandatory before
   calling layout done - the user should never be the one catching visual
   nuances by hand. Recipe below.
8. **Report everything unresolved.** The final report must list every
   remaining rule violation and every placeholder. Never call a manuscript
   "ready" or "camera-ready" while placeholders or known violations remain.

## Visual Proof (render and look) - mandatory for any templated document

Two QA layers, both required: (a) XML artifact scan (rule 6), and (b) a
visual render you actually look at (rule 7). One does not replace the other.

Render DOCX -> PDF -> per-page PNG, then read each PNG as an image:

```
python <this skill>/scripts/render_docx_pages.py "<file.docx>" "<out_dir>" --dpi 110
```

The script converts DOCX->PDF (LibreOffice `soffice --headless` if present,
else MS Word COM on Windows via PowerShell/`ExportAsFixedFormat`, format 17)
and renders pages with PyMuPDF. It also accepts a PDF directly. Then open
each PNG and check, against the template's example:
- overall two-column balance, no half-empty columns or orphaned headings;
- every table looks like the template's table example (rule style, header,
  fit) and its caption sits with it; wide floats truly span both columns;
- equations are the body text size and render as real fractions, not raw
  TeX or oversized glyphs;
- figures fit their column/span, axis labels legible, caption below;
- title/author/affiliation block wraps sensibly (e-mail not stranded).

Note: a DOCX open in Word locks the file; close it (or render a `_v2`
copy). Do this render every time layout code changes, not just once.

## Standard Workflow

1. Identify the venue and read its dedicated skill (if any) fully.
2. Identify the source-of-truth draft (rule 3). Read its edit log.
3. Check the submission deadline against today's date; flag if passed.
4. Number/claim QA (rule 4) on the source draft.
5. Apply venue formatting rules; run the Universal Checks below.
6. Convert (via `markdown-to-docx` or the article's build script), then QA
   the artifact in TWO layers: the XML scan (rule 6) and the visual render
   you look at (rule 7 / Visual Proof section).
7. Sync secondary-language drafts from the corrected source; keep reference
   numbering identical across languages; append a dated entry to the
   draft's edit log describing what was synced.
8. Report: what was fixed, what remains, all placeholders.

## Universal Checks (automate; recipes included)

Run these on every manuscript regardless of venue:

- **Citation order.** Extract bracket citations in body reading order with
  `\[(\d+)\](?:[-–]\[(\d+)\])?` (expand ranges). The first-appearance
  sequence must be exactly `1..N` when the venue numbers by appearance
  (IEEE does). Also: one work = one number; every cited number exists in
  the list and vice versa. To renumber: build old->new map, apply in one
  regex pass, re-sort the list block, re-run the check.
- **Abbreviations.** Follow the venue's scope rule. For IEEE conference
  papers, the abstract and the main text are independent scopes: expand an
  acronym at its first use in the abstract and expand it again at its first
  use in the body. Within each scope, use the abbreviation consistently
  after its definition. Never keep two variant forms of one abbreviation in
  one document (DLSPP vs DLSPPW; FEM vs МКЭ vs spelled-out «методом конечных
  элементов») - pick one form per language and unify it everywhere by
  count-asserted replace. Avoid introducing an abbreviation that is used
  only once or a few times when the unabbreviated term remains readable.
  QA: build a pass/fail first-use inventory of acronym-like Latin and
  Cyrillic tokens separately for the title, abstract, and main text; then
  inspect headings, keywords, captions, and table headings in reading order.
  Exclude chemical formulae, standard SI units, and universally understood
  element symbols. Do not rely on a global occurrence grep: the first
  occurrence in each independent scope must either define the abbreviation
  or use the unabbreviated term. Also grep known variant pairs (explicit
  user corrections, 2026-07-11 and 2026-07-16).
- **Mathematical notation.** Audit every nonstandard symbol, index, state
  label, and derived quantity at its first displayed equation or first use.
  Define it before the reader must infer it, and keep the notation identical
  in prose, equations, figures, and tables. Record a pass/fail inventory for
  indices and symbols rather than checking only that they occur somewhere in
  the manuscript (explicit user correction, 2026-07-16).
- **Keep the abstract self-contained.** Do not refer from the abstract to
  `Fig. 1`, a table, a section, an appendix, or another internal part of the
  manuscript. State the essential geometry, compared methods, and result in
  words that remain understandable when the abstract is indexed separately.
  If a specialized but established component name may be unfamiliar, retain
  the term and explain its position or shape briefly instead of defining it
  only by a figure reference.
- **Match the scope noun to the work performed.** A study that evaluates a
  calculation method is about «расчёт», not automatically about
  «проектирование». Do not add «предварительный» as a generic qualifier; keep
  it only when a preliminary stage is explicitly distinguished from a later
  verification, refinement, or optimization stage.
- **Placeholders.** Grep for `УТОЧНИТЬ`, `TODO`, `FIXME`, `XXX`, `???` -
  each hit must be intentional and reported.
- **Typography.** Decimal points with leading zeros (`0.25`, never `.25`);
  no e-notation in prose (`9e-4` -> `0.0009` or a power of ten); real
  units symbols (`µm`, not `um`); dashes per venue (em/en for IEEE, plain
  hyphen for Ioffe journals - check the venue skill).
- **Numerical precision claims.** Do not report a residual merely because
  the code produces it. First decide whether it has physical or methodological
  meaning at the precision of the model, material data, and reported results.
  If validation against an analytical solution gives a discrepancy many
  orders of magnitude below those limits and controlled only by numerical
  rounding, omit the number from reader-facing prose. Write, for example,
  «Результаты численного расчёта согласуются с аналитическими решениями»,
  and keep the exact residual in tests or reproducibility materials. Never
  replace such a number with "to machine precision", «с машинной точностью»,
  "exact", «точно», or «на уровне округления вычислений двойной точности».
  State the compared quantity, error definition, and numerical threshold only
  when that threshold constrains a scientific conclusion or is itself part of
  the numerical-method study. In that case, choose precision consistent with
  the source data and displayed significant digits. Mention the numeric type
  only when it materially affects the method.
- **Implementation details need a scientific role.** Do not leave isolated
  counts of continuation steps, iterations, initial guesses, mesh elements,
  or similar program settings in reader-facing prose without saying what they
  test. Keep the exact count when reproducibility requires it, but attach the
  purpose and outcome: for example, «устойчивость результата проверена при
  четырёхкратном уменьшении шага; вывод не изменился». If the raw count adds
  no interpretation beyond an already reported refinement ratio and result,
  move it to a detailed method note or supplement, or omit it. Do not remove
  a setting that is the only evidence for a convergence or robustness claim.
  When several diagnostics support the same robustness conclusion, keep one
  reader-interpretable threshold and the refinement outcome in the main text;
  move extra residuals and higher-precision repeats to the data, supplement,
  or project checkpoint. Do not list multiple near-unity overlaps or
  discrepancies far below the manuscript's reported precision unless they
  change the scientific interpretation.
- **Describe scientific choices, not operator actions.** In reader-facing
  prose, replace program/GUI narration such as «программе вручную задано» or
  «программа не находит моду» with the modeled fact and its scientific status:
  «для области условно принято значение ...» or «расчёт не выявил связанную
  моду». State whether a value is a calculated result, initial condition,
  approximation, boundary condition, or diagnostic substitution. Mention
  manual entry or a specific software action only when it affects
  reproducibility or interpretation.
- **Name physical inputs instead of vague data labels.** Do not leave phrases
  such as «материальные данные», “material parameters,” or “input data” when
  the comparison depends on a defined subset of properties. Name the actual
  quantities, wavelength or frequency, materials, and relevant states. In an
  optical model this may mean the complex refractive index or complex
  permittivity for every medium; do not imply that unrelated thermal or
  mechanical properties are part of the calculation.
- **Compare parallel objects.** In captions, headings, aims, and comparison
  sentences, keep the alternatives at the same level of abstraction: results
  with results, methods with methods, and models with models. If one
  alternative is named as a method and the other as a direct equation solution
  or model calculation, introduce a common head such as “results of two ways
  of calculation” and name both alternatives in parallel. Do not grammatically
  compare “calculation by method X” with “structure Y”.
- **Do not manufacture a taxonomy to organize conclusions.** Reject generic
  openers such as «Полученные результаты позволяют разделить ... на три
  уровня» followed by bold labels («пригодно / требует проверки / нельзя»)
  when the categories merely compress unlike findings. Write evidence-led
  paragraphs instead: state the observed agreement and a concrete result;
  then the condition under which the result ceases to be decisive; then the
  quantity or physical question that requires a stronger method. Use a
  numbered classification only when its items are genuinely parallel, each
  class has a defined criterion, and the classification is used later. Never
  mix calculated quantities, failure cases, and validation actions as
  coequal members of one artificial hierarchy.
- **Write short-paper conclusions as a synthesis, not a result inventory.**
  Unless the venue explicitly requires numbered conclusions or the item
  numbers are used later, prefer one to three connected paragraphs. Start
  with the compared object or method and the main physical finding, follow
  with only the decisive quantitative comparisons, and end with their
  interpretation, applicability, or the next validation stage. Do not repeat
  each Results sentence as an isolated numbered item or reuse the same
  sentence frame across a list of findings.
- **State the contribution positively; do not pre-emptively devalue it.**
  Remove unsolicited disclaimers such as “this is not a new theory,” “we do
  not claim the first device,” or “the values are not ready-made device
  specifications.” If priority is not part of the claim, omit priority
  language. Lead with what was calculated, validated, or learned. Preserve
  limitations that affect interpretation, but express them as the scope of a
  supported conclusion or as a specific next validation step, not as a
  detached inventory of everything the study did not do. Use a separate
  limitations list only when the venue requires it or when every item is
  essential, nonredundant, and tied to a stated conclusion.
- **Floats.** Every table/figure is cited in text BEFORE it appears;
  table captions above tables, figure captions below figures (IEEE
  convention; venue skill may differ). Figure axis labels are
  `Quantity (unit)`, figures meet the venue dpi minimum, each figure also
  exists as a separate file.
- **Figures are designed for black-and-white print.** Distinguish series
  and marker lines by line STYLE, marker shape, or hatch pattern - never
  by color alone (color may stay as a secondary cue). Keep hatching thin,
  sparse, and light-gray so fills do not read as bold dirt in print.
  Text labels must not touch or overlap the lines/graphics they annotate -
  offset or stagger them (user correction 2026-07-09: bold hatching and
  S-labels sitting on cut lines). Place legends in an empty data-free region
  or outside the axes; a legend covering a bar, curve, marker, or error bar is
  a defect even when its text remains readable. In-figure wording (legends,
  annotations) must use the manuscript text's own terminology in that
  language - a legend saying "anchor" while the text says "reference" is a
  defect.
  Verify all of this on the rendered page (rule 7), including a mental
  grayscale check.
- **Wikilinks and vault artifacts.** `[[...]]`, Obsidian frontmatter,
  local-note sections ("Локальные источники", GPT notes, edit logs) must
  never leak into the submission artifact.
- **Keep internal file inventories outside reader-facing drafts.** Lists of
  script names, CSV files, figure builders, checkpoints, and local
  reproduction paths belong in a companion project note, not in a manuscript
  being read by a supervisor or reviewer. In an Obsidian working draft,
  replace such an inventory with one short wikilink when navigation is useful;
  remove or convert that link before producing the submission artifact. Keep a
  genuine public code- or data-availability statement in the paper when the
  venue requires one or public materials are actually available.
- **Names.** Cyrillic-to-Latin transliteration is verified per author
  (щ -> shch, ч -> ch, ж -> zh); author-preferred spellings win over
  standard transliteration - ask if unknown.
- **Reader-facing shorthand.** If a recurring attribute term is shorthand
  the target reader may not parse («прозрачные состояния» meaning k≈0 PCM
  states), replace it with the self-explanatory form («слабопоглощающие
  состояния») or define it in place with numbers at first use. A term may
  legitimately stay in ONE language when the cited literature establishes
  it there ("transparent PCM" comes from the cited titles, so EN keeps it
  while RU prose uses the self-explanatory form) - meaning stays identical
  (user correction 2026-07-09).
- **Language purity (RU and EN).** Use the `ru-language-purity` skill - the
  shared source of truth for де-кальке, referenced by every writing skill so
  the checklist is not duplicated here. Russian scientific prose must not
  carry English words (суржик), false friends (careful -> «аккуратный»),
  invented calque compounds («PCM-нагруженный», «бесметалльный»,
  «полно-векторный», «лоссовее»), or imported metaphors (anchor -> «якорь»);
  English is allowed ONLY (a) in parentheses when first defining a term or
  abbreviation, (b) in established abbreviations (PCM, FEM, SPP, PML, COMSOL,
  TM), (c) in reference titles. Register: научный стиль уровня опытного
  ученого. MANDATORY before writing or editing Russian manuscript prose, and
  as a full pass over any RU text translated from an (AI-written) English
  draft: read `ru-language-purity` and its `references/decalque-ru-en.md`
  (strategic rules, replacement tables by defect class, deliberate keeps,
  grep recipe) and apply it. The mirror direction applies too: an English
  version written from a Russian working draft must not keep insider calques
  ("local" = in-house runs, "referred to locally as", unintroduced
  working-title jargon, "COMSOL-side step") - `ru-language-purity` covers
  that direction as well.

## Authoring A Venue Skill From The Journal/Conference Template

This applies when BUILDING a new venue skill (e.g. `apede-...`,
`optics-...`) from the journal's or conference's official template or
author guidelines - not when writing a paper.

- **Inspect the official template/rules document visually, not only by
  extracted text.** Reading the text of a template `.docx`/`.pdf` captures
  the prose rules but MISSES the visual conventions, which are usually the
  ones that get a paper bounced or that the user later has to point out by
  hand: the table rule style (e.g. horizontal rules only vs a full grid),
  heading appearance, one/two-column layout, caption placement, figure/axis
  style, equation numbering position, and non-body parts (page footer
  copyright line, sponsors/funding text box, running headers). Render the
  template to images and LOOK at it (scripts/render_docx_pages.py for
  DOCX/PDF; screenshot the live rules web page), then encode those visual
  rules in the skill and its `references/`.
- Keep the template's own example table and example figure as the reference
  the skill tells future runs to compare their output against.
- Recheck the live author-guidelines page before real submissions; template
  files bundled in a repo go stale.

## Multi-Language Drafts

- The pair (RU draft, EN draft) must stay scientifically identical; only
  language and venue-required blocks differ.
- Reference numbering must be identical in both. After renumbering one,
  renumber the other with the same old->new map.
- Author lists, affiliations, and e-mails must match across all files of
  the article (drafts, build scripts, metadata blocks) - fix with one
  script over all files.
- Every sync gets a dated entry in the draft's edit-log section stating
  exactly what was changed and why. Historical log entries are never
  rewritten - they describe the past.

## Practical Environment Lessons

- A DOCX open in Microsoft Word locks its path (PermissionError on save):
  build to a `_v2` name, tell the user, regenerate the canonical name
  after Word is closed, then delete the stale copy.
- Some publisher DOCX files are ISO Strict OOXML (`purl.oclc.org`
  namespaces); pandoc and python-docx fail on them - parse
  `word/document.xml` directly with the strict namespace.
- Keep the manuscript source in Markdown next to a reproducible build
  script; regenerate the DOCX from source instead of editing the DOCX.
- Keep dated backups of prior camera-ready versions instead of
  overwriting.

## Self-Improvement And Publishing

When manuscript work reveals a durable, reusable, venue-AGNOSTIC lesson,
use the `skill-learning` policy and save it here (compact rule, no session
narrative). Venue-specific lessons go to the venue skill instead. Do not
store secrets, credentials, unpublished manuscript content, referee
correspondence, copyrighted text, generated logs, or one-off facts.

Before materially editing this skill, run the owning repository's
freshness check: fetch `origin main`, compare local `HEAD` with
`origin/main`, fast-forward if behind and clean, inspect dirty/ahead/
diverged states before continuing.

After materially updating this skill, validate the shared base and
adapters when feasible, then commit and push to the owning repository by
default unless the user says not to. Stage only relevant skill files;
split commits by semantic block; avoid vague rollups.

If publishing hits remote changes or merge conflicts, resolve them
autonomously when the intended final meaning is determinable from files,
history, and the user's instruction; otherwise stop and report.

## Guardrails

- Do not submit anywhere; prepare materials and stop.
- Do not delete or overwrite user drafts; create new files or edit with
  the user's explicit direction.
- When this skill and a venue skill disagree, the venue skill wins - but
  say so explicitly in the report.
